1. A dynamic array is a common form of data structure that allows for arbitrary resizing. An everyday example is the list structure in Python. Accessing data in a dynamic array or adding or removing from the end is O(1), while adding or removing from the front is O(n). However, if resizing is necessary, adding will always be O(n).

A blockchain is, as the name suggests, a chain of blocks. Each block consists of information, of which the most important is the proof of work. At the beginning of the blockchain, a particular mathematical function is agreed upon, and each proof of work must apply that function to the previous proof of work. These functions are typically very difficult to compute, thus serving as proof of significant computer work. With the proper proof of work, a computer can have their proposed next block added to the chain, typically including their ownership of that block as part of the information attached to the proof of work. The necessity of the proof of work prevents someone from arbitrarily declaring themselves the owner of part of the chain. However, verification of the proof of work necessarily works on consensus, so the owner of a large enough proportion of the computers working of the proofs of work could simply declare what they wanted, and that would be the new consensus.
